```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r load}
library(here)
library(knitr)
```

Machine learning algorithms used include: `r snakemake@params[['ml_methods']]`.
Models were trained with `r snakemake@params[['nseeds']]` 
different random partitions of the data into training and testing sets.

## Model Performance

```{r plot}
include_graphics(here(snakemake@input[['plot']]))
```
