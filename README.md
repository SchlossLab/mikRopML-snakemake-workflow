# Running mikropml with snakemake

## The Workflow

The [`Snakefile`](Snakefile) contains rules which define the output files we want and how to make them.
Snakemake automatically figures out the dependencies of each of the rules and
what order to run them in.
This [Snakemake workflow](Snakefile) preprocesses the dataset ([`data/otu_large.csv`](data/otu_large.csv)),
calls `mikropml::run_ml()` for each seed and ML method set in[ `config/config.yml`](config/config.yml),
combines the results files,
plots performance results,
and renders a simple [R Markdown report](report.Rmd) as a GitHub-flavored [markdown file](report.md).

## Quick Start

1. Clone or download this repo and go to the directory.

    ``` sh
    git clone https://github.com/SchlossLab/mikropml-snakemake-workflow
    cd mikropml-snakemake-workflow
    ```

    Alternatively you can click the green `Use this template` button to create
    your own version of the repo on GitHub, then clone it.

1. Create a conda environment and activate it.
    ``` sh
    conda env create -f config/environment.yml
    conda activate smk-ML
    ```
    (Recommend [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) if you don't already have conda installed.)

    Alternatively, you can [install snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) and the other dependencies listed in [`config/environment.yml`](config/environment.yml) however you like.
1. Install the mikropml R package. [mikropml install instructions](https://github.com/SchlossLab/mikropml#installation)

    e.g.
    ``` sh
    R -e 'devtools::install_github("SchlossLab/mikropml")'
    ```
1. Edit the configuration file [`config/config.yml`](config/config.yml).
    - `ml_methods`: list of machine learning methods to use. Must be supported by mikropml.
    - `ncores`: the number of cores to use for preprocessing and for each `mikropml::run_ml()` call. Do not exceed the number of cores you have available.
    - `nseeds`: the number of different random seeds to use for training models with `mikropml::run_ml()`.

    The default config file is suitable
    for initial testing, but we recommend using more seeds and cores if available.
    A more robust configuration is provided in [`config/config_robust.yml`](config/config_robust.yml).

1. Do a dry run to make sure the snakemake workflow is valid.
    ``` sh
    snakemake -n
    ```
1. Run the workflow.

    Run it locally with:
    ``` sh
    snakemake
    ```

    Or specify a different config file with:
    ``` sh
    snakemake --configfile config/config_robust.yml
    ```

    To run the workflow on an HPC with SLURM:

    1. Edit your email (`YOUR_EMAIL_HERE`) and SLURM account (`YOUR_ACCOUNT_HERE`) in:
        - [`code/submit_slurm.sh`](code/submit_slurm.sh)
        - [`config/cluster.json`](config/cluster.json)
    1. Submit the snakemake workflow with:
        ``` Âµsh
        sbatch code/submit_slurm.sh
        ```
        The main job will then submit all other snakemake jobs, allowing
        independent steps of the workflow to run in parallel.
        Slurm output files will be written to `log/hpc.`.
1. View the results in [`report.md`](report.md).

    This example report was created by running the workflow on the Great Lakes HPC at the University of Michigan with [`config/config_robust.yml`](config/config_robust.yml).
