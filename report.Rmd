```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,
                      eval = TRUE)
```

```{r load}
library(knitr)
```

Machine learning algorithms used include: `r snakemake@params[['ml_methods']]`.
Models were trained with `r snakemake@params[['nseeds']]` 
different random partitions of the data into training and testing sets.

## Model Performance

```{r perf_plot}
include_graphics(snakemake@input[['perf_plot']])
```

## Runtime

```{r runtime_plot}
include_graphics(snakemake@input[['runtime_plot']])
```
